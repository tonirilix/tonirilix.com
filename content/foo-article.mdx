There are many different ways you could approach a YouTube video about JavaScript, but here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Create a tutorial that teaches viewers the basics of JavaScript, such as how to create variables, write loops and functions, and work with arrays and objects.

2. Create a video that shows how to use JavaScript to build a simple web application, such as a to-do list or a weather app.

3. Create a video that compares JavaScript to other programming languages, such as Python or Java, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each language.

4. Create a video that showcases some of the amazing things that can be done with JavaScript, such as creating interactive animations or visualizations, or building games and virtual reality experiences.

5. Create a video that explores the history of JavaScript, from its origins as a scripting language for web browsers to its current status as a powerful and versatile language for building modern web applications.

Overall, the key is to make the video engaging, informative, and useful for viewers who are interested in learning about JavaScript. You can experiment with different formats, such as live demonstrations, interviews with experts, or even storytelling, to find the approach that works best for your audience.

```js {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
var num1, num2, sum;
num1 = prompt('Enter first number');
num2 = prompt('Enter second number');
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2); // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum); // "+" means combine into a string
```
